# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Jeff Noble]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 17, Monday, 2017].

### Day 1: Nov 14th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my class project, building out a user flow and working on a nav framework

**Thoughts** today was a hard day, this is like 6 weeks into coding every day and today it just seemed like a lot, hoping tomorrow will be a lot better.
